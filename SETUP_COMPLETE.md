# ✅ Setup Complete & Issues Resolved

## Current Status

Your server farm is **UP AND RUNNING**! 🎉

### What's Working:
- ✅ 50 Docker containers running
- ✅ Control Plane API running on port 8000
- ✅ All servers responding to HTTP requests
- ✅ Servers accessible on ports 8001-8050

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. Docker Connection Issue
**Problem**: Control plane couldn't connect to Docker daemon  
**Solution**: Updated `control-plane/main.py` to:
- Use explicit Unix socket path: `unix://var/run/docker.sock`
- Add graceful error handling if Docker isn't available
- Fall back to HTTP-only monitoring when Docker API unavailable

#### 2. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: `docker` Python module wasn't installed  
**Solution**: Ran `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in control-plane directory

#### 3. Health Check Failing
**Problem**: Docker health checks showing "unhealthy" due to missing `requests` module in containers  
**Solution**: Updated `server/Dockerfile` to use `urllib.request` (built-in) instead of `requests` module

**Note**: Servers ARE actually healthy and responding correctly - only the Docker health check was failing. This will be fixed when you rebuild containers.

## Current System Status

```bash
# Check containers (they're running!)
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
docker ps --filter "name=server-" | wc -l
# Shows: 50 containers

# Test a server (works!)
curl http://localhost:8001/health
# Response: {"status":"healthy",...}

# Control Plane API (running!)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/servers | head -20
# Shows: All 50 servers with their status
```

## How to Use Right Now

### Control Plane is Already Running ✅
The control plane is running in terminal with PID 65094 on port 8000.

Access it at: **http://localhost:8000**
API Docs: **http://localhost:8000/docs**

### Test the System

1. **Check all servers via API:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

2. **Get metrics:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/metrics | python3 -m json.tool
```

3. **Test individual server:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/metrics | python3 -m json.tool
```

4. **Run health check tool:**
```bash
cd /Users/prateekro/Documents/projects/ai
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
python3 tools/health_check.py
```

### Start Web Interface

In a NEW terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/prateekro/Documents/projects/ai/web-interface
npm install  # if not already done
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

## Optional: Fix Health Checks

To fix the Docker health check status (currently shows "unhealthy" but servers work fine):

```bash
cd /Users/prateekro/Documents/projects/ai

# Rebuild containers with fixed health check
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
docker-compose build

# Restart containers
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 30 seconds for health checks to pass
sleep 30

# Check status
docker ps --filter "name=server-"
```

After this, containers should show as "healthy" instead of "unhealthy".

## PATH Issue Note

Docker CLI isn't in your default PATH. You have two options:

### Option 1: Add to PATH permanently
Add to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Option 2: Use full path
```bash
/usr/local/bin/docker ps
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose ps
```

### Option 3: Create alias
Add to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
alias docker="/usr/local/bin/docker"
alias docker-compose="/usr/local/bin/docker-compose"
```

## Quick Access URLs

- 🌐 **Web Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000 (start with `npm run dev`)
- 🎮 **Control Plane API**: http://localhost:8000
- 📖 **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- 🖥️ **Server 1**: http://localhost:8001
- 🖥️ **Server 50**: http://localhost:8050

## Test Commands

```bash
# Set PATH for Docker
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# Health check all servers
python3 tools/health_check.py

# Load test 10 servers
python3 tools/load_test.py --servers 10 --requests 100

# Check container status
docker ps | grep server | wc -l

# Check control plane status
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Get all server metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/api/metrics

# Test specific server
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:8025/metrics
```

## What To Do Next

1. **✅ DONE**: Control plane is running
2. **🔄 TODO**: Start web interface (`npm run dev` in web-interface directory)
3. **✅ WORKS**: Test servers with curl
4. **⚪ OPTIONAL**: Rebuild containers to fix health check display

## Summary

Everything is **working correctly**! The servers are all running and responding properly. The only cosmetic issue is that Docker shows them as "unhealthy" due to the health check using a module that isn't installed - but this doesn't affect functionality at all.

**You can start using the system right now:**
- API is accessible at port 8000
- All 50 servers are responding
- Health checks work via HTTP
- Load testing is ready
- Just need to start the web interface

Enjoy your server farm! 🎉🚀
